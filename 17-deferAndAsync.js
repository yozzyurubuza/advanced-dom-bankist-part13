//Efficient Script Loading: Defer and Async

/*

Regular

* If script is at HEAD
Parsing HTML > Fetch Script > Execute > Wait for HTML > Finish Parsing HTML (DOMContentLoaded)

* If script is at BODY END
Parsing HTML > Fetch Script > Execute

- Scripts are fetched and executed after the HTML is completely parsed


Async

Parsing HTML > Waiting > Finish Parsing HTML (DOMContentLoaded)
Fetch Script > Execute
- 2 asynchronous task is executed

- Scripts are fetched asynchronously and executed immediately
- Scripts are not guaranteed to execute in order
- Use for 3rd-party scripts where order doesn't matter (e.g Google Analytics)


Defer

Parsing HTML > Execute
Fetch Script
- No interruption in Parsing HTML

- Scripts are fetched asynchronously and executed after the HTML is completely parsed
- Scripts are executed in order
